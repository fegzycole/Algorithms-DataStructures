## 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String (Easy)

### Problem

Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or -1 if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

- `1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10⁴`
- `haystack` and `needle` consist of only lowercase English characters.

### Examples

**Example 1**  
Input: `haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"`  
Output: `0`  
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6. The first occurrence is at index 0.

**Example 2**  
Input: `haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"`  
Output: `-1`  
Explanation: "leeto" is not found in "leetcode".
