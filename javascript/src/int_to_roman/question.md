Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:

| Symbol | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| I      | 1     |
| V      | 5     |
| X      | 10    |
| L      | 50    |
| C      | 100   |
| D      | 500   |
| M      | 1000  |

Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:

1. **Normal Form:**  
   If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.

2. **Subtractive Form:**  
   If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): `IV` and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): `IX`.  
   Only the following subtractive forms are used:
   - 4 (IV)
   - 9 (IX)
   - 40 (XL)
   - 90 (XC)
   - 400 (CD)
   - 900 (CM)

3. **Repetition Rule:**  
   Only powers of 10 (`I`, `X`, `C`, `M`) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append `5 (V)`, `50 (L)`, or `500 (D)` multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.

## Problem

Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.

### Example 1:

**Input:** `num = 3749`  
**Output:** `"MMMDCCXLIX"`  
**Explanation:**

- 3000 = `MMM` as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
- 700 = `DCC` as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
- 40 = `XL` as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
- 9 = `IX` as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)  
  _Note:_ 49 is not `IL` because the conversion is based on decimal places

### Example 2:

**Input:** `num = 58`  
**Output:** `"LVIII"`  
**Explanation:**

- 50 = `L`
- 8 = `VIII`

### Example 3:

**Input:** `num = 1994`  
**Output:** `"MCMXCIV"`  
**Explanation:**

- 1000 = `M`
- 900 = `CM`
- 90 = `XC`
- 4 = `IV`

## Constraints:

- `1 <= num <= 3999`
